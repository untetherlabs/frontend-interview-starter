# Frontend Interview Starter

Our frontend interviews all start with this template. From here, we'll ask you to build something that will slowly resemble a product feature, such as a todo app, an employee directory, etc.

## Installation

```
pnpm i
pnpm dev // Will start the app on localhost:3000
```
